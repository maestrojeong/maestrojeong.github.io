I'm a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University, advised by [Hyun Oh Song](https://mllab.snu.ac.kr/hyunoh).
I previously graduated from Seoul National University in 2018 with a B.S. in electical and computer engineering. My research interests are combinatorial optimization and machine learning. Also, I'm interested in Web3.
